# ✋🎚️ Hand Gesture Volume Control

## 📌 Project Description
Hand Gesture Volume Control is a computer vision–based application that allows users to control the system volume using hand gestures captured through a webcam. The project provides a touchless and intuitive way to interact with the system by tracking hand movements in real time.

This project demonstrates the practical use of computer vision and gesture recognition techniques using Python.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time hand detection using webcam  
- Gesture-based volume increase and decrease  
- Touchless system volume control  
- Smooth and responsive interaction  
- Live visual feedback on screen  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- MediaPipe  
- NumPy  
- Pycaw (for controlling system volume)  

## ⚙️ How the Project Works
1. The webcam captures live video frames.
2. MediaPipe detects hand landmarks in real time.
3. The distance between specific fingers (such as thumb and index finger) is calculated.
4. Based on the finger distance, the system volume is increased or decreased.
5. Visual indicators are displayed for better user interaction.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 🔹 Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system
- Webcam enabled

### 🔹 Installation
Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pycaw
